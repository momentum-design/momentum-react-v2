The `<AlertBanner />` component. This component accepts multiple scopes of child-like props:

- `image` - The image associated with this component. This will typically be an `<Icon />`
  component.
- `label` - Overrides the `children` prop. The label or message to be displayed with this component.
  This supports escape codes, such as `\n`.
- `buttons` - One or more `<ButtonSimple />` components to be mapped to this `<AlertBanner />`.
  These are heavily re-styled for this component, use custom styling with caution.
- `children` - Virtually identical to the `label` prop, but is overridden by the `label` prop.
