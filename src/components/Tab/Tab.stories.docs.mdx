The `<Tab />` component. This component accepts multiple scopes of child-like props:

- `children` - If it is a string only, it places that string inside a <Text /> component of type
  subheader-secondary. Else, it only accepts a Text or a Icon component.
- `active` - Whether the tab is currently active or not.
- `disabled` - Whether the tab is currently disabled or not.
