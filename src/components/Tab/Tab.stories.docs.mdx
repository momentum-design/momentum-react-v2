The `<Tab />` component. This component accepts multiple scopes of child-like props:

* `children` - If it is a string only, it places that string inside a <Text> component of type subheader-secondary. Else, it only accepts a <Text> or a <Icon> component.
* `active` - Whether the tab is currently active or not.
* `disabled` - Whether the tab is currently disabled or not.
* `open` - Whether the tab is currently open or not.
