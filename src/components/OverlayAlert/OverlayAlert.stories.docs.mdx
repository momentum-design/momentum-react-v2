The `<OverlayAlert />` component is used to bring attention to any provided children of itself by placing a colored element over its parent component or the entire viewport.

Note that the render state of this component must be managed manually from within its various component props, such as `children`, `actions`, or `controls`. This is inclusive of any actions that remove/deconstruct the `<OverlayAlert />` component.

The default `z-index` for this component is `1000`.

Accessibility Note: If you provide a `title` to `<OverlayAlert />` we will provide the necessary `aria-labelledby` and `id` props for screen reader accessibility. If `title` is not provided, consider providing an `ariaLabel` prop with a meaningful label to ensure your component is accessible to screen reader users.

Example:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

    const open = () => {
      setIsOpen(true);
    };

    const close = () => {
      setIsOpen(false);
    };

    return (
      <div id="app">
        <ButtonPill onPress={open}>Open</ButtonPill>
        {isOpen && <OverlayAlert
          actions={<ButtonPill onPress={close} size={28}>OK</ButtonPill>}
          controls={<ButtonControl onPress={close} control="close" />}
          {...args}
        />}
      </div>
    );
  };
}
```
