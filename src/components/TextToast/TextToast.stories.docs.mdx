The `<TextToast />` component. This component is designed to retrieve props like the `text` to
display and the `textAlignment`, which can be `center` or `left` at the moment. If no or an empty
`text` is passed in, the component will not be rendered. If no `textAlignment` is passed in, the
default alignment will be `center`. Also the `iconProps` from the `Icon` component can be passed in
to render a Icon on the left-hand side of the text.
