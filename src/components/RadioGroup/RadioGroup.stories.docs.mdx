The `<RadioGroup />` component.

Options for the component can either be specified in two ways:

- Passing an array of `RadioProps` to the options prop.
- Passing an array of strings to the options prop. The string is used for both the label and the
  value of the button.

The props for `RadioProps` are:

| Prop             | Type                           | Description                                                                                                            |
