[INTERNAL] `<TreeNodeBase />` component should be the base of any Tree Item component that the
Momentum Library requires. This component acts like a skeleton that helps you develop more complex TreeNodes.
It manages many features of the tree, such as focus, keyboard navigation, open/close nodes, etc.

`<TreeNodeBase />` uses the TreeContext from the `<Tree />` component to manage the state of the tree.
If the `<TreeNodeBase />` can not access ot the context, it will throw an error.

`<TreeNodeBase />` allows to navigate into the node itself when there are interactive elements inside it.
After the node selected the user can use the `Tab` key to select the first, second, etc. interactive element.
When the last interactable element is selected, the next tab will move the focus to the next interactable
element after the tree.

`<TreeNodeBase />` might contain other components which have their own focus management, and they're updating tabindex
in the process, for example `<Memu />` component. `<TreeNodeBase />` can preserve these state if the component
(or any parent of it) has either a  `data-preserve-tabindex` attribute or `md-nav-preserve-tabindex` class name.

Content of the `<TreeNodeBase />` does not rendered if the node details are not available from the tree context.

Below are a few examples on how to use it and what you can achieve.

## Structure

`<TreeNodeBase />` is compatible with the `<ListItemBaseSection />` component, it can be used the same way as in the
ListItem component.

The structure of the component is as follows:

```
+---------------+----------------+-------------+
| Start Section | Middle Section | End Section |
+---------------+----------------+-------------+

or

+---------------+----------------+-------------+
|                  Fill Section                |
+---------------+----------------+-------------+
```

The 4 sections can be mixed together as needed. We provide a `<ListItemBaseSection />` component
that will handle spacing and padding accordingly.

## Simple example

```js
<TreeNodeBase>
  <ListItemBaseSection position="start">
    <Avatar title="Webex User" />
  </ListItemBaseSection>
  <ListItemBaseSection position="fill">Webex User</ListItemBaseSection>
</TreeNodeBase>
```

## Complex example

```js
<TreeNodeBase size={50} shape="isPilled">
  <ListItemBaseSection position="start">
    <Avatar title="John Adams" size={32} presence={PresenceType.Active} />
  </ListItemBaseSection>
  <ListItemBaseSection position="fill">Text goes here</ListItemBaseSection>
  <ListItemBaseSection position="end">
    <Icon name="placeholder" scale={16} />
  </ListItemBaseSection>
</TreeNodeBase>
```
