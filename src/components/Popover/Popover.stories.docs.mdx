The `<Popover />` component allows adding a Popover to whatever provided as `triggerComponent`. It
will show the Popover after a specific event, which is defined by the provided `trigger` prop.

The `<Popover />` component also supports a manually-triggered appearance using the `manual` value
assigned to the `trigger` prop. This allows for external visibility handling.
