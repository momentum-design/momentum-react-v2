`<Flex />` is a utility component that acts like an abstract layer which displays child components
using flex.

# Usage

This component **should not** be used as part of the implementation of other components inside this
componeny library. Instead, it should be used by any consumer of the package, and in any
documentation/stories to make it easier to position things around.
