The `<GlobalSearchInput />` component.

This component uses the react-aria useSearchField. See
https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSearchField.html

This component takes an array of active filters and informs the parent component of changes made by
the user using `onFiltersChange` alongside the standard `onChange` method

Each filter contains a translations object which has the necessary strings for describing the
current filter and its add/removal.
