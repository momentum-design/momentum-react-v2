The `<Coachmark />` component.

This component should be used with experience-driven flows, such as the "First Time Experience"
[FTE] for a feature. The visibility of each `<Coachmark />` must be controlled by the `isVisible`
prop, and can be dismissed by changing this prop to `false` or if the user clicks the `dismiss`
button. The `dismiss` button triggers the `onDismiss()` event handler.
