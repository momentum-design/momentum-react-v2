`<Text />` is an independent component that results from the 18 fixed types of text, which come with their own font-size, font-weight*, line-height and text-decorator. Each text type was implemented with its appropriate HTML text element (h1, h2, h3, p, small)
The component can be used with `<Text type='body-primary'>Hello</Text`.
If type is not specified, `body-primary` type is assumed.
