`<Text />` is an independent component that results from the 18 fixed types of text, which come with
their own font-size, font-weight\*, line-height and text-decorator. HTML text element (h1, h2, h3,
p, span, div, small) should be provided in the tagName following page structure accessibility rules.
The component can be used with `<Text tagName='p' type='body-primary'>Hello</Text>`. If type is not
specified, `body-primary` type is assumed.
