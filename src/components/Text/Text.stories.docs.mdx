`<Text />` is an independent component that results from the 18 fixed types of text, which come with
their own font-size, font-weight\*, line-height and text-decorator. Each text type was implemented
with its appropriate HTML text element (h1, h2, h3, p, span, div, small) The component can be used with
`<Text type='body-primary'>Hello</Text>`. If type is not specified, `body-primary` type is assumed.
