The `<FixedWidthButtonPillContent />` component.

This component can be used if you have a `<ButtonPill />`, or a `<ButtonPillToggle />`, component
where the string content changes onPress or as a consequence of a state change. A button which
changes width in these circumstances may change the layout of a page and result in a suboptimal UX.

Tips:

We recommend adding `overflow: hidden;` to the button you use this with. Otherwise the user may be
able to trigger the onPress callback on the button from above the button.

Internally this component uses the Momentum React V2 `<Icon />` and `<Text />` components to mimic
the button content to achieve the fixed width. We recommend using the `<Text />` component for the
string child component to ensure truncation works as expected if you set a maximum width to the
button.
