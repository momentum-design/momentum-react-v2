## React Aria Button Support

This element utilizes `AriaButtonProps` for the `useButton()`
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useButton.html) method. This allows for the
usage of various button aria props, such as `autoFocus`, `onKeyDown` and `onPress`.

Additionally, `AriaButtonProps` allows for the usage of common **aria** attributes, such as
`aria-label` and `aria-details`.
