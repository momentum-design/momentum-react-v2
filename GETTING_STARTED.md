# Getting Started

**Currently, this project is closed to any external contributions. Any pull request made against
this project from external sources will likely be closed. If you would like to make changes to this
project, please fork this project.**

For internal developers, if you would like to contribute to this project, please review our
[contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Cloning

In order to begin utilizing this project, it must be cloned locally. This can be done using multiple
methods, but the preferred method would be to utilize [git](https://git-scm.com/). Once
[git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed and operational on your platform, navigate to the folder
you would like this project to reside in and run the following command:

```bash
# External Developers
git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_FORK}/momentum-react-v2.git

# Internal Developers
git clone git@github.com:momentum-design/momentum-react-v2.git
```

This will download the latest version available via this project's GitHub repository for usage
locally. Once the above command finishes its execution, navigate to that folder using the following
command:

```bash
cd ./momentum-react-v2
```

## Initializing

In order to execute any scripts associated with this project, the projects dependencies must be
initialized using the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

> In case you get `command not found: yarn`, please run `corepack enable` before you try again
> `yarn install`

## Building

In order to build this project for downstream projects, the following command must be used to
compile the source code:

```bash
yarn build # building with yarn package manager

```

## Consumption

In the case of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/), adding the
following dependency to your project's `package.json` file will link this project to your project.

```json
{
  /* ...other package definitions... */
  "dependencies": {
    /* ...other package dependencies... */
    "@momentum-ui/react-collaboration": "link:./path/to/this/project"
  }
}
```

**Note**: Since this package will collide with the
[original @momentum-ui](https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-ui)'s `/react` sub-module, you
may need to alias this package seperately in your `package.json`.

## Usage

Once the package is properly linked, the components can be imported for usage within your
application:

```jsx
/* ...other imports... */
import { Button } from '@momentum-ui/react-collaboration';

const Component = () => (
  <div>
    <Button name="primary" size="large">
      Welcome to Momentum UI - React Collaboration - Button
    </Button>
  </div>
);

/* ...export statements... */
```
